## Features

Easy refactoring Terraform configurations in a scalable way.

- CLI-friendly: Read HCL from stdin, apply filters and write results to stdout, easily pipe and combine other commands.
- Keep comments: Update lots of existing Terraform configurations without losing comments as much as possible.
- Built-in operations:
  - filter awsv4upgrade: Upgrade configurations to AWS provider v4. Only `aws_s3_bucket` refactor is supported.

In short, given the following Terraform configuration file:

```main.tf
$ cat ./test-fixtures/awsv4upgrade/aws_s3_bucket/simple/main.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "tfedit-test"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

Apply a filter for `awsv4upgrade`:

```main.tf
$ tfedit filter awsv4upgrade -f ./test-fixtures/awsv4upgrade/aws_s3_bucket/simple/main.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "tfedit-test"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  acl    = "private"
}
```

Although the initial goal of this project is providing a way for bulk refactoring of the `aws_s3_bucket` resource required by breaking changes in AWS provider v4, but the project scope is not limited to specific use-cases. It's by no means intended to be an upgrade tool for all your providers. Instead of covering all you need, it provides reusable building blocks for Terraform refactoring and shows examples for how to compose them in real world use-cases.

As you know, Terraform refactoring often requires not only configuration changes, but also Terraform state migrations. However, it's error-prone and not suitable for CI/CD. For declarative Terraform state migration, use [tfmigrate](https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfmigrate).

If you are not ready for the upgrade, you can pin version constraints in your Terraform configurations with [tfupdate](https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfupdate).

## awsv4upgrade

For upgrading AWS provider v4, some rules have not been implemented yet. The current implementation status is as follows:

[S3 Bucket Refactor](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/guides/version-4-upgrade#s3-bucket-refactor)

- [x] Arguments of aws_s3_bucket resource
  - [x] acceleration_status
  - [x] acl
  - [x] cors_rule
  - [x] grant
  - [x] lifecycle_rule
  - [x] logging
  - [x] object_lock_configuration rule
  - [x] policy
  - [x] replication_configuration
  - [x] request_payer
  - [x] server_side_encryption_configuration
  - [x] versioning
  - [x] website
- [ ] Meta arguments of resource
  - [ ] count
  - [ ] for_each
  - [ ] dynamic
- [ ] Rename references in an expression to new resource type
- [ ] Generate import commands for new split resources

Known limitations:
- Some arguments were changed not only their names but also valid values. In this case, if a value of the argument is a variable, not literal, it's impossible to automatically rewrite the value of the variable. It potentially could be passed from outside of module or even overwritten at runtime. If it's not literal, you need to change the value of the variable by yourself. The following arguments have this limitation:
  - grant:
    - permissions: A [permissions](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/3.74.3/docs/resources/s3_bucket#permissions) attribute of grant block was a list in v3, but in v4 we need to set each [permission](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_acl#permission) to each grant block respectively. If the `permissions` attribute is passed as a variable or generated by a function, it cannot be split automatically.
  - lifecycle_rule:
    - enabled = true => status = "Enabled"
    - enabled = false => status = "Disabled"
    - transition:
      - date = "2022-12-31" => date = "2022-12-31T00:00:00Z"
    - expiration:
      - date = "2022-12-31" => date = "2022-12-31T00:00:00Z"
  - versioning:
    - enabled = true => status = "Enabled"
    - enabled = false => It also depends on the current status of your bucket. Set `status = "Suspended"` or use `for_each` to avoid creating `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` resource.
- Some arguments cannot be converted correctly without knowing the current state of AWS resources. The tfedit never calls the AWS API on your behalf. You have to check it by yourself. The following arguments have this limitation:
  - grant:
    - owner: A [grant](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/3.74.3/docs/resources/s3_bucket#grant) argument of aws_s3_bucket in v3 doesnâ€™t have an owner block, but an access_control_policy argument of aws_s3_bucket_acl in v4 has an [owner](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket_acl#access_control_policy) block as required. There is no way to set it automatically without the AWS API call. You need to set the owner by yourself. You can get your AWS canonical user id with [`aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket <bucketname>`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-acl.html) or use [aws_canonical_user_id](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/canonical_user_id) data source.

  - lifecycle_rule:
    - filter: When [`aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket <bucketname>`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration.html) returns `"Filter" : {}` without a prefix, you need to set rule.filter as `filter {}`.
  - versioning:
    - enabled: Starting from v3.70.0, `enabled = false` for a new bucket doesn't set "Suspended" explicitly. When [`aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket <bucketname>`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/get-bucket-versioning.html) returns no `"Status"`, which means `"Disabled"`. In this case, you need to remove the `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` resource.

## Getting Started

We recommend you to play an example in a sandbox environment first, which is safe to run `terraform` and `tfmigrate` command without any credentials. The sandbox environment mocks the AWS API with `localstack` and doesn't actually create any resources. So you can safely and easily understand how it works.

Build a sandbox environment with docker-compose and run bash:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfedit
$ cd tfedit/
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run --rm tfedit /bin/bash
```

In the sandbox environment, create and initialize a working directory from test fixtures:

```
# mkdir -p tmp/dir1 && cd tmp/dir1
# terraform init -from-module=../../test-fixtures/awsv4upgrade/aws_s3_bucket/simple/
# cat main.tf
```

This example contains a simple `aws_s3_bucket` resource:

```main.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "tfedit-test"
  acl    = "private"
}
```

Apply it and create the `aws_s3_bucket` resource with the AWS provider v3.74.3, which is the last version without deprecated warnings:

```
# terraform -v
Terraform v1.1.7
on linux_amd64
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v3.74.3

# terraform apply -auto-approve
# terraform state list
```

Then, let's upgrade the AWS provider to the latest v3.x, which allows you to refactor the `aws_s3_bucket` resource before upgrading v4:

```
# tfupdate provider aws -v "~> 3.75" .

# terraform init -upgrade

# terraform -v
Terraform v1.1.7
on linux_amd64
+ provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws v3.75.1
```

Now it's time to upgrade Terraform configuration to the AWS provider v4 compatible with `tfedit`:

```
# tfedit filter awsv4upgrade -u -f main.tf
# cat main.tf
```

You can see the `acl` argument has been split into a `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource:

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "tfedit-test"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_acl" "example" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id
  acl    = "private"
}
```

At this point, if you run the `terraform plan` command, you can see that a new `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource will be created:

```
# terraform plan
(snip.)
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

Now it's time for tfmigrate, which allows you to run the `terraform import` command in a declarative way. Currently, generating a migration file feature has not been implemented yet, so create a migration file manually.

```
# cat << EOF > tfmigrate_test.hcl
migration "state" "test" {
  actions = [
    "import aws_s3_bucket_acl.example tfedit-test,private",
  ]
}
EOF
```

Run `tfmigrate plan` to check to see if `terraform plan` has no changes after the migration without updating remote tfstate:

```
# tfmigrate plan tfmigrate_test.hcl
(snip.)
YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss [INFO] [migrator] state migrator plan success!
# echo $?
0
```

If looks good, apply it:

```
# tfmigrate apply tfmigrate_test.hcl
(snip.)
YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss [INFO] [migrator] state migrator apply success!
# echo $?
0
```

The apply command computes a new state and pushes it to remote state.
It will fail if terraform plan detects any diffs with the new state.

You can confirm the latest remote state has no changes with terraform plan:

```
# terraform plan
(snip.)
No changes. Infrastructure is up-to-date.

# terraform state list
aws_s3_bucket.example
aws_s3_bucket_acl.example
```
